# NYT Article Clone

A design clone of a New York Times online article, as an exercise in html/css, with emphasis on positioning from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements) full stack web development curriculum. 

## Note: 

There seems to be an issue with .svg background images not being able to render on github's html preview page.  If you're using the link below to view the page, or if you clicked on the link provided on the Odin Prject's page, a few icons may fail to show up.

The page should render as intended when viewed locally.
