# NYT Article Clone

A design clone of a New York Times online article, as an exercise in html/css, with emphasis on positioning from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements) full stack web development curriculum. 

## Note: 

There seems to be an issue with .svg background images being able to render on github's html preview page.  If you're using the below to view the page, or if you clicked on the link to this project provided on the Odin Prject's page, a few icons may fail to show up.

This probably won't show up when viewing the page locally.
